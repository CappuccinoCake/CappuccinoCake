### Hey guys ðŸ‘‹

I am CappuccinoCake and am here for just a while, but until today with all private repos with some small projects for private use. In my code I mostly use <b>html, php, javascript, perl, bash<b>. This are the languages that I am able to write.

I am planning to do some projects also as public available repos.

Write me if you have some idea what I could code, maybe I will do the project.

In future there are also updates about the projects here in this README. Please contact me or open an issue when you are interested in some project.
